It is applied at a thickness of 1/16" or 4mm with a sprayer covering 4,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet per day with a 2-man crew. It is fire rated non-ccombustible after reaching a temperature of 2,500 Fahrenheit for 35 minutes and does not support flame spread. It passed a 4-year water resistance test for wind driven rain and snow. The membrane is permeable (breathable) allowing interior water vapor to escape similar to house wraps or waterproof Gore-Tex garments and is resistant to fungus, mold, and mildew. Its ability to stretch was tested to 600%+ at 77 F. and when released it returned to its original shape with 100% memory retention. Solar exposure and weathering was tested and after 4 years showed no evidence of checking, cracking, chalking or loss of coating.

WallGuard was selected in place of stucco for the 96,000 sq. ft. of exterior finish, because of its <strong>superior performance, durability, and maintenance free properties plus it reduced the labor and material cost by 44% saving $178,600</strong>. WallGuard was also used for the walls and ceiling of the indoor pool area. The WallGuard coating has required no repairs or maintenance in over 26 years. <br/><br/> Greg McManus is a retired Senior Engineer & Director of Special Projects for Marriott Hotels as well as at Sto Corporation. After he reviewed WallGuard's fire lab tests and Marriott's Zero Maintenance Report since application in 1999, he made the following comments: <strong>WallGuard is an Integrated Wall System that delivers the best results in cost, sustainability and design flexibility. For hotels and commercial buildings, this is 'pure gold' in maintenance savings</strong></div><div class="col-12 pt-2"> WallGuard's <strong><font color=red>3M ceramic</font></strong> colorized spray-on smooth or stucco texture coating is thermally resistant to wildfire's 1,200℉ heat.
