      Building Departments in each state, Builders and the U.S. Government rely on the thermal efficiency testing conducted at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge, Tennessee National Laboratory to select the most energy efficient building material for their projects. Oak Ridge tested the energy efficiency of twenty-two (22) of the most popular structural exterior building envelopes (walls & roof).  For a project to maximize its energy efficiency and utility savings, the entire building envelope has to be constructed with the most thermally resistant and cost-effective building material. Oak Ridge determined that Structural insulated Panels are 60% more energy efficient (reducing utility cost 35%) than conventional 2" x 6" wood stud framing with insulation.

    details: >-
      This was one of the most complex assembly projects we have tackled.  The project required 14 truck loads. Initially ABD was going to ship the 1st floor panels starting at the north end of the building, then 2nd and 3rd floors.  But the week before we were schedule to start shipping the owner called and told us "we have a problem." Due to an early winter snowstorm and lower temperatures, the concrete foundation was not pored for the south half of the building.  So, we scrambled and flipped the manufacturing schedule to only produce and ship the north half of the building starting with the 1st floor walls 2nd floor, 3rd floor and roof.  Then start over for the 2nd half of the condo when the foundation was poured and cured.

      This home has 6,400 sq. ft. of living space.  At the owner’s request, ABD and our Professional Engineer (PE) engineered the structure to withstand Category-5 hurricane winds of 158 mph.  It has 6.5" SIP walls, 8.25" SIP roof. By adding additional inexpensive fasteners and Simpson anchoring systems, the residence has a certified rating that it would withstand 180 mph, which is 1/2 of its actual calculated rating to withstand 360 mph winds. The owner informed us that his house in Atlanta is approximately the same size and has an average monthly utility cost of $385.  The monthly utility cost of his new SIP home on Daniel Island S.C is $124, which is 67% less.  He also told us "his air-conditioner rarely comes on and he was not sure he needed it".  He put a thermometer sensor in the attic and the highest it ever reached that summer was 80 F. degrees.  In Atlanta it would reach 148+ F.

      This two-story contemporary design home has 2,569 sq. ft. of living space plus a large 2nd floor 650 sq. ft. wrap-around party terrace with parapet walls to enjoy the views of the Denver skyline.  It has a main-level large master bedroom and bath, and on the 2nd floor two large guest bedrooms with separate bathrooms plus a loft/office. The design was to provide large open space for entertaining from the main floor great room, dining area and kitchen and the 2nd floor terrace.

      The following Federal Government projects selected Structural Insulate Panels “SIPs” for their building exteriors due to their: 1) superior energy efficiency, 2) simplicity in assembling-by-number with less skilled labor, and 3) minimal material waste.  In the Antarctic they selected the thickest SIP which is 12.25" where the temperatures dip down to −128.6 °F.  The 2nd project is a U.S. Forrest Service Ranger Station in Colorado with offices, conference rooms and repair and service bays for equipment and vehicles.
