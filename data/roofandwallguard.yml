    description: "<strong>The Marriott Residence Inn Alberta, Canada project was completed in 1999</strong>. WallGuard was selected in place of stucco for the 96,000 sq. ft. of exterior finish, because of its <strong>superior performance, durability, and maintenance free properties plus it reduced the labor and material cost by 44% saving $178,600</strong>. WallGuard was also used for the walls and ceiling of the indoor pool area. The WallGuard coating has required no repairs or maintenance in over 26 years. <br/> <br/> Greg McManus is a retired Senior Engineer & Director of Special Projects for Marriott Hotels as well as at Sto Corporation. After he reviewed WallGuard's fire lab tests and Marriott's Zero Maintenance Report since application in 1999, he made the following comments: <strong>WallGuard is an Integrated Wall System that delivers the best results in cost, sustainability and design flexibility. For hotels and commercial buildings, this is 'pure gold' in maintenance savings</strong>"

    metric: "<strong>FIRE</strong>: WallGuard or RoofGuard, formulated with <strong><font color='red'>3M ceramic</font></strong> coating (RoofGuard has twice the amount ceramic for solar protection as WallGuard), which is sprayed, rolled, or brushed onto the exterior walls and roof at a 6-mil thickness. During Intertek's ASTM'S E2768 30-minute fire test WallGuard eared a Class-A Fire Rating with Zero flame and smoke spread. Plus it withstood 1,675℉ during Intertek's NFPA 285 2-story 30-minute fire test."

    metric: "<strong>ELONGATION</strong>"
    details: Tested to 600%+ elongation at 77 F. and returns to its original dimensions without deformation.
  -
    id: 4
    metric: "<strong>SOLAR</strong>"
    details: "Passed accelerated weathering and solar exposure of 500 hours exposure (equivalent to 4 years) without degradation or signs of checking, cracking, chalking, or coating loss."

    metric: "<strong>INSULATION</strong>"
    details: "WallGuard and RoofGuard adds R-4.8 to the structure. Our Protected Insulation Cladding System (PICS) and it's FCB panel substrate with 1-½ of foam insulation adds R-7.7 for a total wall insulation value of R-12.5. This reduces the cost of air-conditioning by > 20%."

    metric: "<strong>ANNUAL MAINTENANCE</strong>: <b>None Required</b>"
    details: "Damaged walls can be easily repaired with WallGuard applied with paintbrush or roller. Dust buildup can be rinsed oﬀ with a garden hose."

    metric: "<strong>REPAIR CRACKED STUCCO</strong>"
    details: "Apply colorized WallGuard with a brush, roller or sprayer to coat stucco for a long-lasting, elastomeric (stretchy) membrane, that resists fading and water, and fills in cracks up to 1/16 wide. For wider cracks or older, chalking stucco, pre-wash, dry, pre-fill cracks with caulk, then apply WallGuard."

    details: "Link: <strong><a href='https://youtu.be/lA6Lfjb0JWIA' target='_blank'>https://youtu.be/lA6Lfjb0JWIA</a></strong><br> A 2,600℉ torch was used to increase the surface of a single coat of 6 mil thick WallGuard to near 1,000℉ for 1.6 minutes to determine its thermal heat resistance into the house interior. 3M's ceramic reduced the surface temperature of 1,000℉ heat transfer to the wall interior by 69% with a maximum high of 314℉. In the video note the plywood does not ignite. OSB and the wood ignite at 450℉."
