    description: <strong>The Marriott Residence Inn Alberta, Canada project was completed in 1999</strong>. WallGuard was selected in place of stucco for the 96,000 sq. ft. of exterior finish, because of its <strong>superior performance, durability, and maintenance free properties plus it reduced the labor and material cost by 44% saving $178,600</strong>. WallGuard was also used for the walls and ceiling of the indoor pool area. The coating has required no repairs or maintenance in 26 years. Annual inspections confirm its continued performance. The hotel owners and maintenance staff report significant savings due to the maintenance-free property. Rebranded as Lakeview Signature Inn at 2622 39 Ave NE, Calgary.
