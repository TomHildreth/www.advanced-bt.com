    description: "<strong>The Marriott Residence Inn Alberta, Canada project was completed in 1999</strong>. WallGuard was selected in place of stucco for the 96,000 sq. ft. of exterior finish, because of its <strong>superior performance, durability, and maintenance free properties plus it reduced the labor and material cost by 44% saving $178,600</strong>. WallGuard was also used for the walls and ceiling of the indoor pool area. The WallGuard coating has required no repairs or maintenance in over 26 years. <br/> <br/> Greg McManus is a retired Senior Engineer & Director of Special Projects for Marriott Hotels as well as at Sto Corporation. After he reviewed WallGuard's fire lab tests and Marriott's Zero Maintenance Report since application in 1999, he made the following comments: <strong>WallGuard is an Integrated Wall System that delivers the best results in cost, sustainability and design flexibility. For hotels and commercial buildings, this is 'pure gold' in maintenance savings</strong>"

    metric: "<strong>FIRE</strong>: WallGuard or RoofGuard, formulated with <strong><font color='red'>3M ceramic</font></strong> coating (RoofGuard has twice the amount ceramic for solar protection as WallGuard), which is sprayed, rolled, or brushed onto the exterior walls and roof at a 6-mil thickness. During Intertek's ASTM'S E2768 30-minute fire test WallGuard eared a Class-A Fire Rating with Zero flame and smoke spread. Plus it withstood 1,675℉ during Intertek's NFPA 285 2-story 30-minute fire test without ignition."

    metric: "<strong>ELASTOMERIC</strong>"
    details: Tested to 600%+ elongation at 77 F. and returns to its original dimensions without deformation.

    metric: "<strong>INSULATION</strong>"
    details: "According to the Department of Energy formula WallGuard and RoofGuard’s 69% thermal resistance coating adds R-46.4 insulation to the structure walls. Our Protected Insulation Cladding System (PICS) and it's FCB panel substrate with 1-½ of foam insulation adds R-7.7 for a total wall insulation value of R-54. This reduces the cost of air-conditioning by > 20% to 30%, earning Federal Energy Eﬃciency Tax Credit of $1,200 for homeowners and $2,500 for homebuilders."
