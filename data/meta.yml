    Advanced Building and Development or ABD uses leading edge building technology that are energy efficient, with environmentally friendly using sustainable building materials for residential and commercial construction, which cost less in materials and labor than conventional 2x stud lumber framing and insulation construction.  Our building materials include Structural Insulated Panels or SIPs, Solar Photovoltaic Energy, plus passive geothermal and active air-conditioning.  For long life protection of the exterior walls and roof structure from sun, rain, wind and wild fire, we offer spray on WallGuard and RoofGuard.  This near zero energy high performance construction is transformative to the construction industry, which simplifies and deskills the construction process for a more energy efficient, stronger, easy to assemble faster precision construction that has a longer useful life with SIPs and Solar power and reduces utility cost by 42%.

    Not all SIPs are created equal: Our Structural Insulated Panels or SIPs are produced in factories that are audited by a 3rd party, and "certified" by ICC-ES for using only structurally approved raw materials, and the panels are produced following strict operating guidelines.  Therefore, Structural Insulated Panels have earned the right to claim, "they are one of the most structurally engineered and tested building systems in the U.S. and Internationally" and meet the International Building Code and U.S. State Building Codes.  Our factories utilize state-of-the-art automated Computer Numerical Cutting (CNC) equipment and technology with formalized quality control to ensure panel cutting accuracy, plus the customers have final approval of the factory shop drawings before the panels are produced.  Our factories offer "value added services" of factory installed splines and opening framing to simplify and speed up the assembly process for the builder.  A state licensed Professional Engineer (PE) will structurally evaluate the SIP plans to ensure they exceed the state's building codes and the wind and snow loads at the construction site before the PE wet stamps the plans as structurally approved which the local building department will accept.

    Advanced Building & Development asked by the Haitian Government to submit a proposal for emergency quick-to-assemble permanent housing and community centers with commercial kitchens for preparing food, restrooms and showers and sleeping quarters that will withstand CAT-5 hurricanes, seismic rated, and do not require utility connections. All of the materials and tools had to be shipped in containers to Haiti, and kitted for fast, easy assembly with unskilled labor.

    WallGuard and RoofGuard has a 20-year warranty from the manufacturer.  It is applied at a thickness of 1/16" or 4mm with a sprayer covering 4,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet per day with a 2-man crew.  It is fire rated non-combustible after reaching a temperature of 2,500 F. for 35 minutes and does not support flame spread.  It passed a 4-year water resistance test for wind driven rain and snow.  The membrane is permeable (breathable) allowing interior water vapor to escape, similar to house wraps or waterproof Gore-Tex garments and is resistant to fungus, mold, and mildew.  Its ability to stretch was tested to 600%+ at 77 F. and when released it returned to its original shape with 100% memory retention.  Solar exposure and weathering was tested, and after 4 years showed no evidence of checking, cracking, chalking or loss of coating.  WallGuard and RoofGuard add R-4.6 to wall and roof insulation.

    Sustainability begins by selecting building envelop materials that are friendly to the environment, reduce waste, maximize energy efficiency, and have a long useful life.  Orientated Strand Board "OSB" that is used on both sides of the Structural Insulated Panels or SIPs are harvested from three-to-four-year-old plantation 'renewable' growth hardwoods utilizing 92% of the tree material, which are then replanted for the next crop. Whereas wood studs are cut from old-growth timber utilizing 64% of the tree.
