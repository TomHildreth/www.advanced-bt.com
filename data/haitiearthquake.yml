cta: Advanced Building & Development was introduced to a Haitian Government Official who requested a proposal for emergency quick-to-assemble permanent housing and community centers with commercial kitchens for preparing food, restrooms and showers and sleeping quarters that will withstand CAT-5 hurricanes, seismic rated, and do not require utility connections. Our major challenge was that everything had to be shipped in containers to Haiti, and kitted for fast, easy assembly with unskilled labor with basic tools.
