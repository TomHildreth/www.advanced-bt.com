  bottom: Orientated Strand Board "OSB" (that are on both sides of the Structural Insulated Panels or SIPs) are harvested from three-to-four-year-old plantation 'renewable' growth hardwoods utilizing 92% of the tree material, which are then replanted for the next crop. Whereas wood studs are cut from old-growth timber utilizing 64% of the tree.

    description: "<strong>LEED Point Awards from U.S. Green Building Council</strong> SIPs energy savings of 60% earns 16 LEED points (62% of Certified).  SIPs energy efficiency reduces the amount of solar energy required thus scaling down the size and cost of the Solar PV system by 36%. Plus, you receive a Federal Energy Tax Credit of 22% (in year 2021) and Solar adds 3 more LEED points for a total of 73% of Certified."
