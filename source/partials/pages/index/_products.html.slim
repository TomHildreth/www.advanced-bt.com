      |WallGuard passed a 4-year laboratory solar test without cracking or chalking.  Actual installations confirm for over 20 years WallGuard has withstood winter freeze-thaw & summer high solar heat cycles due to the ceramic composition and elastomeric membrane which stretches 600%+ and returns to original shape with 100% memory.

      |WallGuard's cost is over 70% less (labor & materials) than stucco, engineered lumber and wood siding.  It can also be custom tinted and matched to any color. WallGuard requires very little if any maintenance. If dust collects use a garden hose to rinse it off.
