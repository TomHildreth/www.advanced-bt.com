        WallGuard and RoofGuard are formulated with <strong><font color='red'>3M's ceramic</font></strong> and are highly fire resistant. Intertek labs used ASTM's E-84 test to measure WallGuard's flame spread, and determined "it is the only coating they have tested that earned the Class-A Fire Rating". Intertek also used the NFPA-285 exterior wall fire test with combustible components in 18' high chimney that reached 1,675â„‰ for 30-minutes with no flame spread or combustion.

      |WallGuard passed a 4-year laboratory solar test without cracking or chalking.  Actual installations confirm for over <strong><font color='red'>45</font></strong> years WallGuard has withstood winter freeze-thaw & summer high solar heat cycles due to the ceramic composition and elastomeric membrane which stretches 600%+ and returns to original shape with 100% memory.

      |WallGuard's cost is over 70% less (labor & materials) than stucco, engineered lumber and wood siding.  It can also be custom tinted and matched to any color. WallGuard requires very little if any maintenance. If dust collects use a garden hose to rinse it off.
